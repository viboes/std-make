# Default Tuple-like access 
===========================

**Abstract**

Defining tuple-like access `tuple_size`, `tuple_element` and `get<I>/get<T>` as comparison operators,  as proposed in [N4475], for simple classes is tedious, repetitive, slightly error-prone, and easily automated. 

I propose to (implicitly) supply default versions of these operations, if needed. The meaning `get<I>` is to return a reference to the I<sup>th</sup> member.

# Introduction

Defining tuple-like access `tuple_size`, `tuple_element` and `get<I>/get<T>`, as defining comparison operators as proposed in [N4475], for simple classes is tedious, repetitive, slightly error-prone, and easily automated. 

I propose to (implicitly) supply default versions of these operations, if needed. The meaning `get<I>` is to return a reference to the I<sup>th</sup> member. 

If the simple defaults are unsuitable for a class, a programmer can, as ever, define more suitable ones or suppress the defaults. The proposal is to add the operations as an integral part of C++ (like =), rather than as a library feature. 

The proposal follows the same approach as Default comparison as in [N4475], that is, that having default generated code for these basic operations only when needed and possible would make the language simpler. 

The concerned classes would be the same as the one on which Structural Binding [P0144R0] can be applied.

This paper contains no proposed wording. This is a discussion paper to determine EWG interest in the feature, and if there is interest to get direction for a follow-up paper with wording.

# Motivation

Algorithms as `std::tuple_cat` and `std::experimental::apply` work as well with tuple-like types. There are many more of them, a lot of the homogeneous container algorithm are applicable to heterogeneous containers and functions, see [Boost.Fusion] and [Boost.Hana]. Some examples os such algorithms are  `fold`, `accumulate`, `for_each` `any_of`,  `all_of`, `none_of`, `find`, `count`, `filter`, `transform`, `replace`, `join`, `zip`, `flatten`.

Beside `std::pair`, `std::tuple` and `std::array` we have that in particular aggregates are good candidate to be considered as tuple-like types. However defining the tuple-like access functions is tedious, repetitive, slightly error-prone, and easily automated. 

Some libraries, in particular [Boost.Fusion] and [Boost.Hana] provide some macros to generate the needed reflection instantiations. Once this reflection is available for a type, the user can use the struct on  algorithm working with heterogeneous sequences. Very often, when macros are used for something, it is hiding a language feature.

Proposals such as Structural binding [P0144R0] (or its competitor [P0151R0]) would provide already a positional access. This proposal and structural binding should use the same restrictions on the types that can be applied.

# Proposal

I propose to generate default versions for `tuple_size`, `tuple_element` and `get<I>/get<T>` when needed. If those defaults are unsuitable for a type, `=delete` them. If non-default of those operations are needed, define them (as always). If an operation is already declared, a default is not generated for it. This is exactly the way assignment and constructors work today and as comparison operators would work is [N4475] is adopted.

A library solution could be an alternative once we have the necessary reflection traits.

## Common restrictions

A default implementation of the tuple-like access for objects of a class can be generated unless the class

* contains protected or private non-static data members, or
* contains protected or private or virtual base classes, or
* contains a public base class that fulfills some of these restrictions. 
 
We expect that a follow-up for [P0144R0] will define the same restrictions but we are not sure the first version would allow inheritance.

## Tuple-like access

Given a class `C` that doesn't define the tuple-like access and it is not restricted by the previous conditions, let 

* `N` be the number of public non static data members,
* `Ti` the type of the i<sup>th</sup> data member (0 based).

The following could be defined

```c++
namespace std {
    template <>
      struct tuple_size<C> : integral_constant<size_t, N> {}    
    template <>
      struct tuple_element<i, C> { using type = Ti; }    // for i in 0..N-1
      
    template <size_t I>
      constexpr tuple_element_t<I, C>& get(C& c) noexcept;    
    template <size_t I>
      constexpr tuple_element_t<I, C> const& get(C const& c) noexcept;    
    template <size_t I>
      constexpr tuple_element_t<I, C> && get(C && c) noexcept;    
    
    template <class T>
      constexpr T& get(C& c) noexcept;    
    template <class T>
      constexpr T const& get(C const& c) noexcept;    
    template <class T>
      constexpr T && get(C && c) noexcept;    
}
```


This definition would be in line with the tuple-like access as defined for `std::tuple`. 

## Explicit conversion to `std::pair<T,U>` and `std::tuple<Ts...>`

We could make any class `C` satisfying the constraints and having 2 data members having types `T` and `U` to be explicitly convertible to `std::pair<T,U>`.

We could make any class `C` satisfying the constraints and having `N` data members having types `T1` ... `Tn` explicitly convertible to `std::tuple<T1,..., Tn>`.

We could generate the explicit conversions  `operator std::pair<T,U>` and `operator std::tuple<Ts...>`. However the syntax is not friendly. Instead we propose to overload the new `to_pair` and `to_tuple` functions in the namespace of the class `C`.

```c++
namespace Cns {
    class C; 
    auto to_pair(C const&); 
    auto to_tuple(C const&); 
}
```

## Concerned classes in the standard

The definition of the tuple-like access could be removed in the text of the standard for the following classes:

*  `std::pair<T,U>`
*  `std::tuple<Ts...>`

# Design Rationale

## What about inheritance?

With the adoption of Extension to aggregate initialization [P0017R0], it is coherent to permit public inheritance as we want the tuple-like access to be generated for aggregates.

## Do we want to consider base classes or its data members as elements of the tuple-like class ?

[P0017R0] considers the base classes as element of the aggregation. 

We don't know yet what Structured bindings [P0144R0] but suspect that it would consider base classes as elements of the structure binding.

The tuple-like access to `std::tuple` is member oriented even if the order is not required. Having coherent order of members and template parameters could permit to convert from a tuple to a tuple having some of the last members removed.

This is why this proposal give recursive access to the member of the base classes.

## Do we need conversions

We can consider `std::tuple` as the underlaying type of such structures. It seems reasonable to have a conversion to it. 

Having this conversion will allow the user to use functions that work with `std::tuple`.
 
## Why not implicit conversions?

So what kind of conversions are desired? `std``tuple<T,U>` is implicitly convertible to `std::pair<T,U>`. 

Note that the cost of the conversion means a copy and that this is more expensive. The cost of copying  two elements could be less expensive than copying more. 

## Why not explicit conversion operator?

We could generate also the explicit conversion operator, but the syntax is less friendly than the `to_tuple` function.

# Alternative solutions

Based on a future reflection library e.g. [N4428] or [N4451], we could define the tuple-like access instead of generating it (of course, for classes satisfying the tuple-like access generation requirements).  

Next follows a incomplete implementation when inheritance is not considered.

```c++
namespace std {namespace experimental {namespace reflect { inline namespace v1 {

    template <class C>
    struct is_tuple_like_generation_enabled : bool_constant<
        is_class<C>{} &&
        //   no private or protected non-static data members
        class_protected_non_static_data_members<C>::size==0 &&
        class_private_non_static_data_members<C>::size==0 &&
        //   no base classes (this is the restriction of the draft - no inheritance)
        class_base_classes<C>::size==0
        > {};
        
    template <class C, class Enabler=void>
    struct tuple_size
    template <class C, class Enabler=enable_if_t<is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>{}> >
    struct tuple_size<C> : size_t_constant<class_public_non_static_data_members<C>::size> {};

    template <size_t N, class C, class Enabler=void>>
    struct tuple_element;
    template <size_t N, class C, class Enabler=enable_if_t<is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>{}>>
    struct tuple_element<N, C> { 
        using pointer = class_public_non_static_data_members<C>::get<N>::pointer
        using type = decltype(std::declval<C>().*declval<pointer>());
    };
}}}
```
```c++
// default definition for tuple_size changed
template <class C>
struct tuple_size : reflect::tuple_size<C> {}

// default definition for tuple_element changed
template <size_t N, class C>
struct tuple_element { using type = typename reflect::tuple_element<N, C>::type; }

// overloads of get when reflect::is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>
template <size_t N, class C, class Enabler=enable_if_t< N < tuple_size<C>{} and reflect::is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>{} >>
 constexpr reflect::tuple_element_t<N,C>& get(C & that) noexcept
{
    typename reflect::tuple_element<N,C>::pointer pm;
    return that.*pm;
}

template <size_t N, class C, class Enabler=enable_if_t< N < tuple_size<C>{} and reflect::is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>> >
constexpr const tuple_element_t<N,C>& get(const C & that) noexcept
{
    typename reflect::tuple_element<N,C>::pointer pm;
    return that.*pm;
}

template <size_t N, class C, class Enabler=enable_if_t< N < tuple_size<C>{} and reflect::is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>> >
constexpr reflect::tuple_element_t<N,C>&& get(C && that) noexcept
{
    typename reflect::tuple_element<N,C>::pointer pm;
    return std::forward<reflect::tuple_element_t<N,C>&&>(that.*pm);
}

} // namespaces
```

Note that the default traits `tuple_size` and `tuple_element` have been redefined. Maybe using Concepts this could be relaxed.

```c++
// default definition for tuple_size changed
template <class C>
requires reflect::is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>{}
struct tuple_size : reflect::tuple_size<C> {}

// default definition for tuple_element changed
template <size_t N, class C>
requires N < tuple_size<C>{} and reflect::is_tuple_like_generation_enabled<C>{}
struct tuple_element { using type = typename reflect::tuple_element<N, C>::type; }
```

# Implementability

This proposal needs some compiler magic, either by generating directly the tuple-like access or by providing the reflection traits as e.g. in [N4428] or [N4451].

# Open Questions

The authors would like to have an answer to the following points if there is at all an interest in this proposal:

* Do we want a default or a reflection solution?

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to all those that have commented the idea on the std-standard ML better helping to identify the constraints, in particular to Nicol Bolas and Matthew Woehlke.
